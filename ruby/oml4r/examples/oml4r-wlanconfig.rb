# = oml4r-wlanconfig.rb
#
# == Description
#
# This is a simple example on how to use the OML4R module to create a simple
# ruby application that "wraps" around the existing command "wlanconfig".
# This wrapper invokes "wlanconfig" at regular interval, captures and formats
# its output (= measurements), and finally pass them to OML4R, which will in 
# turn either store them in a local file or forward them to the OML Server.
#
require "rubygems"
require "oml4r"

APPNAME = "wlanconfig"
APPPATH = "/sbin/wlanconfig"


#
# This class defines the Measurement Point for our application and the
# corresponding metrics we would like to capture
#

  param :aid, :type => :int32

  param :dbm, :type => :int32
  param :idle, :type => :int32
  param :txseq, :type => :int32
  param :rxseq, :type => :int32
  # Note: other metrics potentially returned by wlanconfig are 
  # not supported here, as they are seldom set by wlanconfig.
  # These are: caps, acaps, erp, mode
end

# This class is the Wrapper around the existing "wlanconfig" application

  # - output =  a String holding the output to process
  #
  def processOutput(output)
    # wlanconfig returns a sequence of lines
    # The 1st line is a list of labels for the fields of the remaining lines
    # Each remaining line is for a given station, and follow the format:
